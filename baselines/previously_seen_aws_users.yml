description: This search looks for CloudTrail events where a src_user logs into the console,
  then creates a baseline of the latest and earliest times, City, Region, and Country
  we have encountered this src_user in our dataset, grouped by ARN, within the last 30
  days.
eli5: In this support search, we look for console login events by a particular src_user
  and create an initial baseline cache for the previous 30 days, including the earliest
  and latest times, City, Region, and Country a particular src_user ARN is seen in our
  dataset, grouped by the ARN value. In cases where City and Region cannot be determined,
  the source IP address is substituted for these values.
entities:
  - src_user
  - src
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Please validate the src_user name entries in `previously_seen_users_console_logins.csv`,
  which is a lookup file created as a result of running this support search.
