description: This search establishes, on a per-hour basis, the average and the standard
  deviation of the number of API calls made by each user. Also recorded is the number
  of data points for each user. This table is then outputted to a lookup file to allow
  the detection search to operate quickly.
eli5: This search returns all log events that are API calls, pulls out the ARN that
  initiated each call, and collects them in one-hour groupings. Next, it calculates
  the number of API calls made per ARN per hour. For each ARN, it calculates the average
  and standard deviation of this count on a per-hour basis.  It also includes the
  number of data points each ARN had. This table is then stored in a lookup file.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS version (4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
