description: This search establishes, on a per-hour basis, the average and the standard
  deviation for the number of API calls related to security groups made by each user.
  Also recorded is the number of data points for each user. This table is then outputted
  to a lookup file to allow the detection search to operate quickly.
eli5: Use this search to create a baseline for API calls related to security groups
  by the users who initiated this activity. It returns all logged API calls for all
  security-group-related activity, pulls out the ARN that initiated each call, and
  collects the `eventNames` in one-hour groupings. Next, it calculates the number
  of API calls made per ARN per hour. For each ARN, it calculates the average and
  standard deviation of this count on a per-hour basis. It also includes the number
  of data points for each ARN. This table is stored in a lookup file.
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS version (4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. To add or remove API event names for security groups, edit the macro `security_group_api_calls`.
