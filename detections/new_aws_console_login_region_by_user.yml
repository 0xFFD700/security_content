eli5: In this search, we query CloudTrail logs to look for events that indicate that
  a src_user has attempted to log in to the AWS console from a new region and group the
  events using ARN value. Using the `previously_seen_users_console_logins.csv` lookup
  file created using the support search, we compare the ARN to all the previously
  seen ARN and region combinations logging into the AWS console. The `eval` and `if`
  functions determine whether the earliest time we see this src_user ARN was seen within
  the last hour. The alert will be fired only when a src_user is seen for first time in
  the last hour.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Run the "Previously seen users in CloudTrail" support search only once to
  create a baseline of previously seen IAM users within the last 30 days. Run "Update
  previously seen users in CloudTrail" hourly (or more frequently depending on how
  often you run the detection searches) to refresh the baselines.

known_false_positives: When a legitimate new src_user logins for the first time, this
  activity will be detected. Check how old the account is and verify that the src_user
  activity is legitimate.
