eli5: In this search, we query CloudTrail logs to look for events where an instance
  is successfully launched by a particular user. Since we want to detect a high number
  of instances launched within a short period, we create event buckets for 10-minute
  windows. We then compare the total number of instances launched by a particular
  user against the saved baseline data in the model ec2_excessive_runinstances_v1.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. The threshold value should be tuned to your environment.
