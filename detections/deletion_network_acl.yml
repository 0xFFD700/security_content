description: Enforcing network-access controls is one of the defensive mechanisms
  used by cloud administrators to restrict access to a cloud instance. After the attacker
  has gained control of the AWS console by compromising an admin account, they can
  delete a network ACL and gain access to the instance from anywhere. This search
  will query the CloudTrail logs to detect users deleting network ACLs.

eli5: The search looks for CloudTrail events to detect whether any network ACLs have
  been deleted and gives you values of error messages and error codes (if any), user
  details, user source IP, the user who initiated this request, and the name of the
  event.

  - src_user
how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
