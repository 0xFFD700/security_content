eli5: This search looks for the process reg.exe with the "save" parameter, which specifies
  a binary export from the registry. In addition, it looks for the keys that contain
  the hashed credentials, which attackers may retrieve and use for brute-force attacks
  in order to harvest legitimate credentials.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints, to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
