eli5: 'This search and its corresponding subsearch run through a series of steps,
  as per the following: \

  1. Retrieves all the AWS CloudTrail log entries that have recorded AWS API calls.\

  1. Kicks off a subsearch that retrieves the same data and pulls out the ARN into
  a more friendly format.\

  1. Counts the number of API calls per ARN.\

  1. Loads the cache file that contains the number of data points, the count from
  the latest hour, the API call average, and the standard deviation for each ARN.\

  1. Drops the count from the latest hour, since it is not necessary, and merges the
  rest of the data with the results of the stats command. \

  1. Renames `apiCalls` as `latestCount`.\

  1. Calculates the new average value for each ARN with the latest count, weighting
  the past much more heavily than the current hour. It does the same for the standard
  deviation--weighting the past more heavily than the current.\

  1. Updates the cache file with the latest results.\

  1. Sets the minimum threshold for the number of data points and sets the number
  of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.\

  1. Makes a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by
  checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is
  a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.\

  1. Filters out anything that it determines is not a spike and returns the list of
  ARNs to the main search. The main search subsequently gets the names of all the
  API calls, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for
  each of these ARNs. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and
  returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from
  the average.'

how_to_implement: 'You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. You can modify `dataPointThreshold` and `deviationThreshold` to better fit
  your environment. The `dataPointThreshold` variable is the minimum number of data
  points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine.
  The `deviationThreshold` variable is the number of standard deviations away from
  the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike.\

  This search produces fields (`eventName`,`numberOfApiCalls`,`uniqueApisCalled`)
  that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed
  when a notable event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the
  notable. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already
  present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management
  > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\\n1. **Label:** AWS Event Name, **Field:**
  eventName\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** Number of API Calls, **Field:** numberOfApiCalls\

  1. \

  1. **Label:** Unique API Calls, **Field:** uniqueApisCalled\

  Detailed documentation on how to create a new field within Incident Review may be
  found here: `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.3.0/Admin/Customizenotables#Add_a_field_to_the_notable_event_details`'
