eli5: This search detects the creation of a remote thread into LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service).
  This technique can be used by attackers to inject code into LSASS and dump the memory in order to obtain credentials.

how_to_implement: 'This search needs Sysmon Logs with a Sysmon configuration, which includes EventCode 8 with lsass.exe. This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.'

known_false_positives: Other tools can access LSASS for legitimate reasons and generate an event. In these cases, tweaking the search may help eliminate noise.
