The data used for this search is usually generated via logs that report process tracking in your Windows audit settings. In addition, you must also have only the `process_name` (not the entire process path) marked as \"prohibited\" in the Enterprise Security <code>interesting processes</code> table. To include the process names marked as \"prohibited\", which is included with ES Content Updates, run the included search <code>Add Prohibited Processes to Enterprise Security</code>.",
