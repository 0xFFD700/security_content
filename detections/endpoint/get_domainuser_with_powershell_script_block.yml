description: his search is to detect a powershell command Get-DomainUser to do user
  enumeration to the active directory. This command is function seen in powerspoit
  and powerview tool that are designed to pentest active directory or domain controller
  for possible attack. This is a good TTP for alerting SOC if there is a pentest or
  recon happening on the system. try to look for lateral movement technique or credential
  dumping techniques in the system.
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 Message = "*Get-DomainUser*" | stats count min(_time)
  as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by EventCode Message ComputerName User | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `get_domainuser_with_powershell_script_block_filter`'
how_to_implement: The following Hunting analytic requires PowerShell operational logs
  to be imported. Modify the powershell macro as needed to match the sourcetype or
  add index. This analytic is specific to 4104, or PowerShell Script Block Logging.
