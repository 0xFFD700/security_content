eli5: This search looks for changes of the ExecutionPolicy in the registry. The ExecutionPolicy
  is a safety feature that controls the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration
  files and runs scripts. Usually, the ExecutionPolicy is "Restricted" for Windows clients and
  "RemoteSigned" for Windows Servers, allowing only certain scripts to run. This search detects
  when an attacker sets the ExecutionPolicy to "Unrestricted" or "Bypass."

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Registry node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with the fields registry_path, registry_key_name, and registry_value_name from your endpoints.

known_false_positives: Administrators may attempt to change the default execution
  policy on a system for a variety of reasons. However, setting the policy to "unrestricted" or "bypass"
  as this search is designed to identify, would be unusual. Hits should be reviewed
  and investigated as appropriate.
