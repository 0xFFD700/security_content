eli5: In this search, we query CloudTrail logs to look for events where an instance
  is successfully terminated by a particular user. Since we want to detect a high
  number of instances terminated within a short period, we create event buckets for
  10-minute windows. We then calculate the total number of instances terminated by
  a particular user, as well as the average- and standard-deviation values. Assign
  a `threshold_value` in the search. Try starting with 3 (but it will likely need
  to be tweaked for your environment). The `eval` function will set the outlier to
  1 if the number of instances is greater than the average number of instances terminated,
  added to the multiplied value of threshold and standard deviation. We then filter
  out outliers with a value of 1 and show only those instance-termination events that
  happened within the previous 10 minutes.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.
