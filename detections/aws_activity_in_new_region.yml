eli5: In this search, we query CloudTrail logs to look for events that indicate that
  an instance was started in a particular region. Using the `previously_seen_aws_regions.csv`
  lookup file created using the support search, we compare the region where this instance
  was started to all previously observed regions. The `eval` and `if` functions determine
  that the earliest times seen for this region and instance were within the last day.
  If a new region is detected, it will alert you with "Instance Started in a New Region".
  However, this region will be added to the list of `previously_seen_aws_regions.csv`.
  Please maintain `previously_seen_aws_regions.csv`

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail
  inputs. Run the "Previously seen AWS Regions" support search only once to create
  of baseline of previously seen regions.
