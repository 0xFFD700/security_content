eli5: A network access control list (ACL) is a layer of security for your VPC that
  acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. Network
  ACLs with all open ports have a larger attack surface. This search looks for events
  within your CloudTrail logs to check if there were any Network ACLs created with
  ports ranging from 1024 to 65525. This search will create a table comprised of AWS
  account id, src, user and all parameters of the request made by the user and the
  server response.

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS, version 4.4.0 or later, and configure your CloudTrail
  inputs.

  open for some legitimate purpose however, this should be scoped and not allowed
