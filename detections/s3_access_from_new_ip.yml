eli5: 'Here the subsearch executes first and returns all successful S3 bucket-access
  attempts (HTTP code "200") within the last hour. It groups the results by the earliest
  and latest times it has seen a remote IP accessing a particular bucket. It appends
  this information to the historical data from the lookup file and then recalculates
  the `firstTime` and `lastTime` field for each remote IP accessing an S3 bucket.
  Next, it returns only those remote IP addresses that have first been seen accessing
  a specific bucket within the past hour. This is combined with the main search to
  return the time, bucket name, source IP, city, and country operations performed,
  as well as the requested URI of the resource '

how_to_implement: You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later)
  and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your S3 access
  logs' inputs. This search works best when you run the "Previously Seen S3 Bucket
  Access by Remote IP" support search once to create a history of previously seen
  remote IPs and bucket names.

known_false_positives: S3 buckets can be accessed from any IP, as long as it can make
  a successful connection. This will be a false postive, since the search is looking
  for a new IP within the past hour
