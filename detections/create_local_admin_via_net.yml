eli5: Net.exe is a built-in Windows command-line tool that can be used to add, display,
  or modify user accounts. While Microsoft administrators use this tool to manage
  user groups, threat actors often leverage it to create local admin accounts to maintain
  persistence. In this search, we are looking for the execution of process net.exe
  with command-line parameters such as `localgroup`, `add`, or `user` that may correspond
  to the creation of local admin accounts or setting user/group properties.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model.
