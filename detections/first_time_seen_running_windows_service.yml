eli5: 'This search looks for a change in the status of a Windows service and extracts
  the name of the service and the action taken by the service. Then the cache file
  of previously seen Windows services is added to the search. At this point, the search
  takes two different paths: the first updates the cache file with the latest information
  and the second searches for services that have never before been seen. It returns
  the time, the Windows host name, and the service name.'

how_to_implement: While this search does not require you to adhere to Splunk CIM,
  you must be ingesting your Windows security-event logs in order for this search
  to execute successfully. The support search, `Previously Seen Running Windows Services`,
  should be run before this search to create the baseline of known Windows services. Please ensure that the Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Windows is version 5.0.0 or above.
