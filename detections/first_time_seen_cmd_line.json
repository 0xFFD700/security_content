Please make sure you run the support search \"Previously seen command line arguments,\"&#151;which creates a lookup file called `previously_seen_cmd_line_arguments.csv`&#151;a historical baseline of all command-line arguments. You must also validate this list. For the search to do accurate calculation, ensure the search scheduling is the same value as the `relative_time` evaluation function.",
