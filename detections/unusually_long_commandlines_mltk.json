  "eli5": "This search leverages the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) to identify outliers in the length of the command lines observed to be used by a specific user. The companion search, \"Baseline of Command Line Length - MLTK,\" creates a machine-learning (ML) model built over the historical data used by this search. The determination of what is considered an outlier may be adjusted via the threshold parameter in the search. More information on the algorithm used can be found at `https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/4.2.0/User/Algorithms#DensityFunction`.",
  "how_to_implement": "You must be ingesting endpoint data that monitors command lines and populates the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the \"process\" field in the Endpoint data model. In addition, MLTK version >= 4.2 must be installed on your search heads, along with any required dependencies. Finally, the support search \"Baseline of Command Line Length - MLTK\" must be executed before this detection search, as it builds an ML model over the historical data used by this search. You should periodically re-run the support search to rebuild the model with the latest data available in your environment.",
  "known_false_positives": "Some legitimate applications use long command lines for installs or updates. You should review identified command lines for legitimacy. You may modify the first part of the search to omit legitimate command lines from consideration. If you are seeing more results than desired, you may consider changing the value of threshold in the search to a smaller value. You should also periodically re-run the support search to re-build the ML model on the latest data. You may get unexpected results if the user identified in the results is not present in the data used to build the associated model.",
