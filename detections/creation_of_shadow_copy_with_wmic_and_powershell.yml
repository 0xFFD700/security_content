eli5: The ntds.dit file contains the Active Directory (AD) database. This file can't be copied directly.
  That's why attackers create a shadow copy before exfiltrating the file. This search detects the creation
  of a shadow copy using wmic, which is executed by Powershell.

how_to_implement: You must enable Powershell scriptblock logging in order to detect this attack.This search uses an input macro named `sysmon`. We strongly recommend that you specify your environment-specific configurations (index, source, sourcetype, etc.) for Windows Sysmon logs. Replace the macro definition with configurations for your Splunk environment. The search also uses a post-filter macro designed to filter out known false positives.
