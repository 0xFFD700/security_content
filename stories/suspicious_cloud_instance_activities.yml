description: Use the searches in this Analytic Story to monitor your Cloud instances
  for evidence of anomalous activity and suspicious behaviors, such as instances
  that originate from unusual locations or those launched by previously unseen users
  (among others). Included investigative searches will help you probe more deeply,
  when the information warrants it.
narrative: AWS, GCP and Azure have extensive logging capabilities that helps you enable governance, compliance,
  and risk auditing within your Cloud Infrastructure. Actions taken by a user, role, or an
   service are recorded as events in their logs. It is crucial for a company to
  monitor events and actions taken in the Console, command-line interface, and APIs to ensure that your instances are not vulnerable to attacks.
  This Analytic Story identifies suspicious activities in your Cloud instances and
  helps you respond and investigate those activities.
