narrative: 'This Analytic Story supports you to detect Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
  (TTPs) from Cobalt Strike. Cobalt Strike has many ways to be enhanced by using aggressor scripts, malleable C2 profiles, default attack packages, and much more. 
  For endpoint behavior, Cobalt Strike is most commonly identified via named pipes, spawn to processes, and DLL function names. 
  On the network, depending on the malleable C2 profile used, it is near infinite in the amount of ways to conceal the C2 traffic with Cobalt Strike.\
