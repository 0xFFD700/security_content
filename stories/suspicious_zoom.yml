narrative: 'Zoom is a leader in modern enterprise video communications and its usage has
    increased dramatically with a large amount of the population under stay-at-home orders
    due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With increased usage has come increased scrutiny and 
    several security flaws have been found with this application on both Windows and macOS
    systems.\
    
    Current detections focus on finding new child processes of this application on a per host
    basis. Investigative searches are included to gather information needed during an investigation.'
