description: "Validate indicator existence, reputation, detonation and determine if\
  \ Known APT, Commodity, Suspicious or Not Malicious?\n    1. If Splunk present,\
  \ run Splunk Query on each indictor and prevalence in the environment. Summarize\
  \ # of times indicator seen in the last 24 hrs, 7 days, 1 month, six months increments.\
  \ Return the hosts that have used this indictor. (make an artifact for each host?)\n\
  \      a. search -> ```| stats ...```\n    2. Gather repetitional, intelligence\
  \ and general information regarding indicator into a note (a note for each indicator)\n\
  \    3. Perform any additional research regarding indicators and understanding what\
  \ normal behaviour is or should be by using using search engines, knowledge bases\
  \ etc.\n    4. Make a determination of indicator, Known APT, Commodity, Suspicious\
  \ or Not Malicious and whether to tag to block indicator\n      a. This should align\
  \ to a severity change (Known APT = High, Commodity = Med, Suspicious = Low, Not\
  \ Malicious = Info)\n      b. Change container and artifact severity and tag artifact\
  \ & indicator(s) with blocked and determination tag"
