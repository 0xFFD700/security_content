  "narrative": "It is a common practice for attackers of all types to leverage native Windows tools and functionality to execute commands for malicious reasons. One such tool on Windows OS is <code>netsh.exe</code>,a command-line scripting utility that allows you to--either locally or remotely--display or modify the network configuration of a computer that is currently running. <code>Netsh.exe</code> can be used to discover and disable local firewall settings. It can also be used to set up a remote connection to a host from an infected system.<br></br>To get started, run the detection search to identify parent processes of <code>netsh.exe</code>.",
