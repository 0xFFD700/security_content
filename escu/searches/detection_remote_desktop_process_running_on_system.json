The search requires you to identify systems that do not commonly use remote desktop. You can use the included support search \"Identify Systems Using Remote Desktop\" to identify these systems. After identifying them, you will need to add the \"common_rdp_source\" category to that system using the Enterprise Security Assets and Identities framework. This can be done by adding an entry in the assets.csv file located in <code>SA-IdentityManagement/lookups</code>.",
