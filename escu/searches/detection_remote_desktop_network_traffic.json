Categories are applied to systems using the Assets and Identity framework.",
  "how_to_implement": "To successfully implement this search you need to identify systems that commonly originate remote desktop traffic and that commonly receive remote desktop traffic. You can use the included support search \"Identify Systems Creating Remote Desktop Traffic\" to identify systems that originate the traffic and the search \"Identify Systems Receiving Remote Desktop Traffic\" to identify systems that receive a lot of remote desktop traffic. After identifying these systems, you will need to add the \"common_rdp_source\" or \"common_rdp_destination\" category to that system depending on the usage, using the Enterprise Security Assets and Identities framework.  This can be done by adding an entry in the assets.csv file located in SA-IdentityManagement/lookups.",
