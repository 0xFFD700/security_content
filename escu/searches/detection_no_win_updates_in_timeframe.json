For Windows endpoints, Microsoft typically releases patches on the second Tuesday of every month. These patches contain fixes for vulnerabilities in the system that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors. This search checks for messages regarding Windows updates in the 'Update' data model. If a message indicating a successful update has not been observed in 60 days, a notable event will be generated. These systems should be checked to determine why it has not been updated in that time frame.",
  "how_to_implement": "To successfully implement this search, it requires that the 'Update' data model is being populated. This can be accomplished by ingesting Windows events or the Windows Update log via a universal forwarder on the Windows endpoints you wish to monitor. The Windows add-on should be also be installed and configured to properly parse Windows events in Splunk. There may be other data sources which can populate this data model, including vulnerability management systems.",
