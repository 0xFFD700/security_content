  "eli5": "This search may look complex, but it's a neat representation of how statistics can help you understand your dataset to bubble up events that are not normal compared to its behavior. The search consists of three parts. The first part of the SPL fetches the data you want to work on. In this search, we calculate the sum of bytes sent and bytes_out from systems categorized as email_server to each host. We then calculate the average and standard deviation for the bytes sent to all the hosts combined and on a per-host basis. Then we set threshold values to deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples using eval statements. The \"deviation_threshold\" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The \"minimum_data_samples\" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.  We then check for byte transfers that are statistically significantly higher than normal. The search then gives IP address of the host, the time of the increased byte transfer, how much data was transferred, and the average amount of data transfer the email server normally sends to all hosts and to this specific host. Finally, it includes the number of standard deviations away the byte count was from these averages.",
  "how_to_implement": "This search requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model.  Your email servers must be categorized as \"email_server\" for the search to work, as well. You may need to adjust the deviation_threshold and minimum_data_samples values based on the network traffic in your environment. The \"deviation_threshold\" field is a multiplying factor to control how much variation you're willing to tolerate. The \"minimum_data_samples\" field is the minimum number of connections of data samples required for the statistic to be valid.",
  "known_false_positives": "The false-positive rate will vary based on how you set the deviation_threshold and data_samples values. Our recommendation is to adjust these values based on your network traffic to and from your email servers.",
