  "eli5": "This search queries the Endpoint file-system data model node to list out all the values of destination machines, as well as the values of file hashes and file paths that have the file \"program.exe\" in the C: drive. Path interception occurs when an executable is placed in a specific path so that it is executed by an application instead of by the intended target. In this case, applications vulnerable to path interception (because of unquoted service paths with spaces in Windows registry) allow attackers to execute maliciously crafted program.exes.",

This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response products, such as Carbon Black, or other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report file system reads and writes.",
