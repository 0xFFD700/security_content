The Playbook executes the Contextual and Investigative searches in this Story, conducts additional information gathering on Windows endpoints, and takes a response action to shut down the affected endpoint. To use this integration, install the Phantom App for Splunk <code>https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/</code>, add the correct hostname to the \"Phantom Instance\" field in the Adaptive Response Actions when configuring this detection search, and set the corresponding Playbook to active. <br/>(Playbook Link:<code>https://my.phantom.us/4.1/playbook/excessive-account-lockouts-enrichment-and-response/</code>).<br></br>",
