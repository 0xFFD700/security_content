The intent is to create an initial baseline cache of names of the API calls per security role for the previous 30 days--including the earliest and latest times seen in our dataset--grouped by the value of user role and the name of the API call. It is also worth noting that the role of a particular user is parsed as \"userName\" in the CloudTrail logs.",

Please validate the user role entries in <code>previously_seen_api_calls_from_user_roles.csv</code>, which is a lookup file created as a result of running this support search.",
