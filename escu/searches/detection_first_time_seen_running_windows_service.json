  "eli5": "This search looks for a change in the status of a Windows service and extracts the name of the service and the action taken by the service. Then the cache file of previously seen Windows services is added to the search. At this point, the search takes two different paths: the first updates the cache file with the latest information and the second searches for services that have never before been seen. It returns the time, the Windows host name, and the service name.",
