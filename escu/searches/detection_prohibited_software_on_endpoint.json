  "how_to_implement": "To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model in the processes node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response products, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is usually generated via logs that report reads and writes to the registry or populated via Windows event logs, after enabling process tracking in your Windows audit settings. In addition, you must also have processes marked as \"prohibited\" in the Enterprise Security <code>interesting processes</code> table. To include the processes marked as \"prohibited\", which is included with ES Content Updates, run the included search <code>Support - Add Prohibited Processes to ES</code>.",
