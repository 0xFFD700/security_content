  "eli5": "A common password across user accounts generally indicates that the users are choosing poor passwords or that a fraudster has a common password across multiple accounts embedded within a script. The search will extract the username and password information from the form_data field, then calculate the number and values for usernames that have the same passwords. Finally, it outputs the values where the unique usernames sharing passwords are greater than 5",
  "how_to_implement": "We need to start with a dataset that allows us to see the values of usernames and passwords that users are submitting to the website hosting the Magento2 e-commerce platform (commonly found in the HTTP form_data field). A tokenized or hashed value of a password is acceptable and certainly preferable to a clear-text password. Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs, customized IIS, and Splunk Stream.",
  "known_false_positives": "As is common with many fraud-related searches, we are usually looking to attribute risk or synthesize relevant context with loosely written detections that simply detect anamoluous behavior.",
