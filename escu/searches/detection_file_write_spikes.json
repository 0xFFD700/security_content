  "eli5": "This search calculates counts the number of file modification events per hour per host in your environment. It then takes the average and standard deviations of those numbers and displays any hosts with more than 20 events that have over four times the standard deviation more than the average number of file modifications.",
  "how_to_implement": "In order to implement this search, you must populate the Endpoint file-system data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection and response products, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes to the file system.",
  "known_false_positives": "It is important to understand that if you happen to install any new applications on your hosts or are copying a large number of files, you can expect to see a large increase of file modifications.",
