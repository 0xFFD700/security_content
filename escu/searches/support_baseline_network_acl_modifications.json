  "eli5": "Use this search to create a baseline for API calls related to network ACLs for the users who initiated this activity. It returns all logged API calls for network activity, pulls out the ARN that initiated each call, and collects the <code>eventNames</code> in one-hour groupings. Next, it calculates the number of API calls made per ARN per-hour. For each ARN, it calculates the average and standard deviation of this count on a per-hour basis. It also includes the number of data points for each ARN. This table is stored in a lookup file.",
