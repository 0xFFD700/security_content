This lookup file can be edited directly where it lives in <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/DA-ESS-ContentUpdate/lookups</code>, or via the Splunk console. You should add the names of services an attacker might use on the command line and surround with asterisks (<b>*</b>), so that they work properly when searching the command line.
