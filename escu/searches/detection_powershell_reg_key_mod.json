In addition, it looks for parameters that specify the registry key to be added or modified, as well as the value of \"Unrestricted\". The appearance of \"ExecutionPolicy\" at the beginning of the search is there to optimize the search performance by first looking for that keyword, and then further searching through the matching events for further details.",
