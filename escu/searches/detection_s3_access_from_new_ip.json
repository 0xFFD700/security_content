It groups the results by the earliest and latest times it has seen a remote IP accessing a particular bucket. It appends this information to the historical data from the lookup file and then recalculates the <code>firstTime</code> and <code>lastTime</code> field for each remote IP accessing an S3 bucket. Next, it returns only those remote IP addresses that have first been seen accessing a specific bucket within the past hour. This is combined with the main search to return the time, bucket name, source IP, city, and country operations performed, as well as the requested URI of the resource ",
