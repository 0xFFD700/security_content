Using the <code>previously_seen_aws_regions.csv</code> lookup file created using the support search, we compare the region where this instance was started to all previously observed regions. The <code>eval</code> and <code>if</code> functions determine that the earliest times seen for this region and instance were within the last day. If a new region is detected, it will alert you with \"Instance Started in a New Region\". However, this region will be added to the list of <code>previously_seen_aws_regions.csv</code>.
