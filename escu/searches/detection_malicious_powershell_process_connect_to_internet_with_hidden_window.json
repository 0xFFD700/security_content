The search for \"*-WindowStyle*\" and \"*hidden*\" are to see if the window that would normally be displayed will be hidden from the user instead. Finally, the search for \"*New-Object*\" and \"*System.Net.WebClient*\" are there to check to see if a PowerShell object that can be used to download files will be created.
