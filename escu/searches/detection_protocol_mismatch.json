For example, looking for network traffic other than HTTP running over TCP port 80. Such behavior could indicate a misconfiguration or a custom command and control protocol that has been designed to look like ordinary web traffic. The search will also identify if HTTP traffic is observed running on unexpected ports. This can be common in many environments.",

Technologies such as Bro and Palo Alto Networks firewalls are two examples that will identify protocols via inspection, and not just assume a specific protocol based on the transport protocol and ports.",
