  "eli5": "It's suspicious when someone or something is moving throughout your website too quickly or with a perfect click cadence. Fortunately, it's easy to detect by calculating the time between clicks for each session and highlighting the anomalous behavior.",
  "how_to_implement": "Start with a dataset that allows you to see clickstream data for each user click on the website. That data must have a time stamp and must contain a reference to the session identifier being used by the website. This ties the clicks together into clickstreams. This value is usually found in the http cookie. With a bit of tuning, a version of this search could be used in high-volume scenarios, such as scraping, crawling, application DDOS, credit-card testing, account takeover, etc. Common data sources used for this detection are customized Apache logs, customized IIS, and Splunk Stream.",
