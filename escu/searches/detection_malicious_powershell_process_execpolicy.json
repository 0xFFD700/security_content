  "eli5": "This search looks for PowerShell processes that were launched using a parameter designed to bypass the local PowerShell execution policy. By default, the policy is set to \"Restricted,\" which disables the execution of PowerShell scripts. In environments that make heavy use of PowerShell, the policy can be set to allow only scripts signed by a trusted publisher. Malicious PowerShell use almost always includes the parameter <code>-ExecutionPolicy bypass</code>. PowerShell is very liberal when it comes to interpreting command-line parameters passed to it. For example, the parameter we look for, <code>-ExecutionPolicy</code>, can be abbreviated to <code>-Execution</code>, <code>-Exec</code>, or even <code>-ex</code>. As such, we look for <code>* -ex*</code>, which should catch all variations of this parameter, followed by the keyword <code>bypass</code>. This search will return the host, the user the process ran under, the process and its command-line arguments, the number of times it has seen this process, and the first and last times it saw this process.",
