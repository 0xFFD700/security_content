  "how_to_implement": "First, you'll need to ingest data from your DNS operations. This can be done by ingesting logs from your server or data collected passively by Splunk Stream or similar solutions. Specifically, data that contains the domain that is being queried and the IP of the host originating the request must be populating the Network_Resolution data model. This search also leverages a lookup file, <code>dynamic_dns_providers_default.csv</code>, which contains a non-exhaustive list of Dynamic DNS providers. Please consider updating the local lookup periodically by adding new domains to the list of <code>dynamic_dns_providers_local.csv</code>.",
