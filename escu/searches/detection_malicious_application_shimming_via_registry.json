An application compatibility shim is a small library that transparently intercepts an API (via hooking), changes the parameters passed, handles the operation itself, or redirects the operation elsewhere, such as additional code stored on a system. This capability can be also leveraged by attackers to create and store malicious files in a shim database as observed in CARBANAK backdoor.",

This is typically populated via endpoint detection and response products, such as Carbon Black or other endpoint data sources such as Sysmon.
