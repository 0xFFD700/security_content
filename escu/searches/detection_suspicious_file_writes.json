  "eli5": "This search looks at files being created or modified in the Endpoint file-system data model. The names of those files are checked against an included lookup file, which contains the names of files associated with malware or attack activity. The search returns any files with matching names, along with a note (also specified in the lookup file) that gives or points to more information about the files.",
  "how_to_implement": "You must be ingesting data that records the filesystem activity from your hosts to populate the Endpoint file-system data model node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response products, such as Carbon Black, or via other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report file system reads and writes. In addition, this search leverages an included lookup file that contains the names of the files to watch for, as well as a note to communicate why that file name is being monitored. This lookup file can be edited to add or remove file the file names you want to monitor.",
  "known_false_positives": "It's possible for a legitimate file to be created with the same name as one noted in the lookup file. Filenames listed in the lookup file should be unique enough that collisions are rare. Looking at the location of the file and the process responsible for the activity can help determine whether or not the activity is legitimate.",
