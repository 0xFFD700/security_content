It checks each URL an endpoint is connecting to against a list of dynamic DNS providers. It returns the source and destination IP address of the web request, the URL requested, and the first time the event occurred.",

You can obtain these logs from indexing data from a web proxy or by using a network-traffic-analysis tool, such as Bro or Splunk Stream. The web data model must contain the URL being requested, the IP address of the host initiating the request, and the destination IP. This search also leverages a lookup file, <code>dynamic_dns_providers_default.csv</code>, which contains a non-exhaustive list of dynamic DNS providers. Consider periodically updating this local lookup file with new domains.",
