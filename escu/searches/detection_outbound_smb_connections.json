  "eli5": "In this search, we are looking for the network connections that were not blocked by the firewall and that are destined for destination port 139 or 445. We then filter out events that have Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks categorized as internal in the <code>assets_by_cidr.csv</code> lookup file which is located in <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-IdentityManagement/lookups/</code>. Since we are only looking for outbound traffic from the hosts made to the Internet, we filter out traffic whose destination IP address is private.",
  "how_to_implement": "In order to run this search effectively, we highly recommend that you leverage the Assets and Identity framework. It is important that you have good understanding of how your network segments are designed, and be able to distinguish internal from external address space. Add a category named <code>internal</code> to the CIDRs that host the company's assets in <code>assets_by_cidr.csv</code> lookup file, which is located in <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-IdentityManagement/lookups/</code>. More information on updating this lookup can be found here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/5.0.0/Admin/Addassetandidentitydata. This search also requires you to be ingesting your network traffic and populating the Network_Traffic data model",
  "known_false_positives": "It is likely that the outbound Server Message Block (SMB) traffic is legitimate, if the company's internal networks are not well-defined in the Assets and Identity Framework. Categorize the internal CIDR blocks as <code>internal</code> in the lookup file to avoid creating notable events for traffic destined to those CIDR blocks. Any other network connection that is going out to the Internet should be investigated and blocked. Best practices suggest preventing external communications of all SMB versions and related protocols at the network boundary.",
