They do the same for the standard deviation--weighting the past more heavily than the current.</li><li>Update the cache file with the latest results.</li><li>Set the minimum threshold for the number of data points and set the number of standard deviations away from the mean it must be to be considered a spike.</li><li>Make a determination regarding whether or not the current count is a spike by checking to see if the minimum data-point threshold has been met and the count is a sufficient number of standard deviations away from the average.</li><li>Filter out anything that it determines is not a spike and return the list of ARNs to the main search. </li></ol>The main search subsequently gets the names of all the API calls, the number of unique API calls, and the total number of API calls for each of these ARNs. Finally, it looks up the average and standard deviation and returns both the average and the number of standard deviations the spike is from the average.",
  "how_to_implement": "You must install the AWS App for Splunk (version 5.1.0 or later) and Splunk Add-on for AWS (version 4.4.0 or later), then configure your CloudTrail inputs. You can modify <code>dataPointThreshold</code> and <code>deviationThreshold</code> to better fit your environment. The <code>dataPointThreshold</code> variable is the minimum number of data points required to have a statistically significant amount of data to determine. The <code>deviationThreshold</code> variable is the number of standard deviations away from the mean that the value must be to be considered a spike. This search works best when you run the \"Baseline of Network ACL Activity by ARN\" support search once to create a lookup file of previously seen Network ACL Activity. To add or remove API event names related to network ACLs, edit the macro <code>NetworkACLEvents</code>.",
