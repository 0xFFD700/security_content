  "eli5": "Attackers often leverage various scripting languages to execute their attacks. In a Windows environment, the Windows Script Host is the tool that interprets the scripts and is included in all modern versions of Windows. The Windows Script Host is available as a command-line tool called \"cscript.exe\" or \"wscript.exe.\" To detect this behavior, the search looks for process-creation events for cscript.exe or wscript.exe with a parent process of cmd.exe. The search will return the count, the first and last times this behavior was seen on a destination machine, and user and process information.",
