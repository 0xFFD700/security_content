  "how_to_implement": "You must be ingesting Windows Security logs. You must also enable the account change auditing here:http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.0.2/Data/MonitorWindowseventlogdata. Additionally, this search requires you to enable your Group Management Audit Logs in your Local Windows Security Policy and to be ingesting those logs.  More information on how to enable them can be found here: http://whatevernetworks.com/auditing-group-membership-changes-in-active-directory/. Finally, please make sure that the local administrator group name is \"Administrators\" to be able to look for the right group membership changes.",

For this reason, it's best to verify the account with an administrator and ask whether there was a valid service request for the account creation. If your local administrator group name is not \"Administrators\", this search may generate an excessive number of false positives",
