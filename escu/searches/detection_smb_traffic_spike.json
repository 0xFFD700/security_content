  "eli5": "Server Message Block (SMB) traffic, a protocol used for Windows file sharing-activity, is often leveraged by attackers. One example of SMB abuse was the WannaCry ransomware, which leveraged a vulnerability in the SMB protocol to propagate to other systems. Attackers have also used SMB for lateral movement with a target environment and to test credentials against target systems. While SMB is highly prevalent in Windows environments, a spike in SMB traffic may still be indicative of this type of malicious activity. This search looks for a traffic spike in SMB traffic from a particular system. If such a spike is detected, you may want to investigate the source and analyze the cause of the abnormal traffic.",
